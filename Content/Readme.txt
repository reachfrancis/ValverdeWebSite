Note..:

You must install the RubyInstaller for windows to get the Sass application.

Then go to the   http://Sass-lang.com/install and get instructions on installing Sass.

The instructions should pretty much tell you to run gem install sass..


Run the CompileSass.cmd so that the Sass files are automatically watched and automatically compile into Css.

Since the command will be modifying the files, you need to check-out the CssStyle folder, and the
SassStyle folder since its what you will be modifying.
